Otomata in HTML5
========================

##About##

Otomata in HTML5 demo is based on the awesome flash music generator by [Batuhan Bozkurt](http://www.earslap.com/). Method was reversed engineered and ported into canvas with HTML5 audio support.

I release only the JS source of the demo, as you can easily deploy it to a page using [HTML5 Boilerplate template](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate) by Paul Irish or you can just create a page with a div id="main" in it to host the game.

##Required libraries##

* [jQuery (1.5.1+)](http://jquery.com)

##Features##

* Uses requestAnimationFrame
* Optimized for iOS devices (although they are not recommended for gameplay as canvas in mobile Safari is pretty slow and doesn't support more than one sounds playing at once)

##Future possible features##

* Diagonal moves
* Better audio support (ogg vorbis)
